# Development Guide

Welcome! Thank you for wanting to make the project better. This section provides an overview on how repository structure
and how to work with the code base.

Before you dive into this, it is best to read:

* The [Code of Conduct][code of conduct]
* The [Contributing][contributing] guide

## Docker

The GBQ project uses Docker to ease setting up a consistent development environment. The Docker documentation has
details on how to [install docker][install-docker] on your computer.

Once that is configured, the test suite can be run locally:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm test
```

If you want to be able to execute code in the container:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm devbox
(your code here)
```

In the devbox environment you'll be able to enter a python shell and import `gbq` or any dependencies.

## Debugging

The docker container has [pdb++][pdbpp-home] install that can be used as a debugger. (However, you are welcome to set up
a different debugger if you would like.)

This allows you to easily create a breakpoint anywhere in the code.

```python
def my_function():
    breakpoint()
    ...
```

When your the code, you will drop into an interactive `pdb++` debugger.

See the documentation on [pdb][pdb-docs] and [pdb++][pdbpp-docs] for more information.

## Testing

You'll be unable to merge code unless the linting and tests pass. You can run these in your container via:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm test
```

This will run the same tests, linting, and code coverage that are run by the CI pipeline. The only difference is that,
when run locally, `black` and `isort` are configured to automatically correct issues they detect.

Generally we should endeavor to write tests for every feature. Every new feature branch should increase the test
coverage rather than decreasing it.

We use [pytest][pytest-docs] as our testing framework.

#### Stages

To customize / override a specific testing stage, please read the documentation specific to that tool:

1. [PyTest][pytest-docs]
2. [MyPy][mypy-docs]
3. [Black][black-docs]
4. [Isort][isort-docs]
4. [Flake8][flake8-docs]
5. [Bandit][bandit-docs]

### `setup.py`

Setuptools is used to packaging the library.

**`setup.py` must not import anything from the package** When installing from source, the user may not have the
packages dependencies installed, and importing the package is likely to raise an `ImportError`. For this reason, the
**package version should be obtained without importing**. This is explains why `setup.py` uses a regular expression to
grabs the version from `__init__.py` without actually importing.

### Requirements

* **requirements.txt** - Lists all direct dependencies (packages imported by the library).
* **requirements-test.txt** - Lists all direct requirements needed to run the test suite & lints.

## Publishing the Package

TODO: The project currently only has parts of this process implemented. The CI pipeline does not currently publish the
wheel and source distribution to [PyPI][pypi]. For now, this must be done manually.

Once the package is ready to be released, there are a few things that need to be done:

1. Start with a local clone of the repo on the default branch with a clean working tree.
2. Run the version bump script with the appropriate part name (`major`, `minor`, or `patch`).
    Example: `docker-compose run --rm bump minor`
    
    This wil create a new branch, updates all affected files with the new version, and commit the changes to the branch.

3. Push the new branch to create a new pull request.
4. Get the pull request approved.
5. Merge the pull request to the default branch.
6. Double check the default branch has all the code that should be included in the release.
7. Create a new GitHub release. The tag should be named `vX.Y.Z` to match the new version number.

This will trigger the CI system to build a wheel and a source distributions of the package and push them to
[PyPI][pypi].

## Continuous Integration Pipeline
